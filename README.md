# The Endless Yarn

The Endless Yarn is a personal project I did during my time at _[DCI](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/de/)_ to complete the Single Page Application module of my professional training.

**Live version:** [The endless yarn in React](https://catalinaf-s.github.io/Final-Project-SPA-React/). [^1]

[^1]: Currently, the live version is experimenting a bug caused by the routing of GitHub pages, which initially redirects to the 404 error. However, the pages on the site are working fine. Feel free to navigate them. I am working on a solution for this problem. üòÅ

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to redesign the original project [The-endless-yarn](https://github.com/CatalinaF-S/The-endless-yarn) into a responsive website using my knowledge of `React`, `CSS` and `HTML`.

## Components:

1. **App Container**:
   It contains all the logic of the website. The components have access to this information through the Hook `useContext`.

2. **Navbar**:
   Responsive Navbar which in mobile view shows an interactive hamburger menu.

4. **Carousel**:
   Component that allows to visualize images in a predetermined order by using two buttons `next` and `previous` .

5. **Projects**:
   Under construction... It will contain the information of the knitted projects that I have realized in my free time.

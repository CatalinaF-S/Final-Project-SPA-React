                Hi! I am Catalina. I am a just normal, kind, creative and
                curious person who really enjoys life with all its little
                details. Among my long list of hobbies, knitting is one of my
                favorites. It has given me moments of peace and meditation in
                hard moments of the life. Knitting has helped me to know myself
                better and to discover new skills and values of myself.
